# parking-management-system

### This is the codebase for the project we're working on i.e. "Parking Optimization and Management System for 2 Wheelers in Constrained Parking Lots"

## The plan:
- PostGreSQL, FastAPI for the backend.
- For the frontend, we preferably need an App that talks to our API, Which maybe implemented in Flutter for it's speed.
- We'll have to figure out what modules we need to import to train the time series model based on previous data.
